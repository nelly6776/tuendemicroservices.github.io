Documentation - When you run the microservice application using ASP.NET Core, Swagger is automatically loaded, providing you with a convenient interface to explore and interact with your API endpoints. You can use Swagger to explore your API endpoints, test requests, and view response schemas. For instance; POST /api/Passenger: Create a new user.
GET /api/Passenger/{id}: Retrieve Passenger details by ID.
PUT /api/Passenger/{id}: Update Passenger information.
DELETE /api/Passenger/{id}: Delete Passenger profile. 
The same happens to the rider entity.
